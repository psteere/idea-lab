## Stoic Reflection
**Quote:** "Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one." — Marcus Aurelius

**Prompt:** In the spirit of the 'Idea Lab', it’s easy to get caught up in planning, refining, and theorizing about our perfect systems or career moves. Today, where can you stop *preparing* to be great and simply *act* with the integrity and excellence you envision?

**Pete's Reflection:**
Ahh pragmatism at its core. Do something, theorizing is cheap. Talk is cheap. Get out there and do the thing.
