## Stoic Reflection
**Quote:** "First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do." — Epictetus

**Prompt:** In the context of your projects (like the Idea Lab or your hardware upcycling), how are your actions today directly shaping the 'Digital Revivalist' you aim to be?

**Pete's Reflection:**
Having clear focus is key to success as it allows you to be resolute in your actions towards a clear goal. Without it, efforts are diluted, outcomes are unknown, and the target is not able to be hit. Also, it is infinitely more difficult to appropriately adapt when the target is not known, because you're not sure where you're going or why you need to pivot. With no Why, the How cannot possibly be evident or efficient. Define goals, that prompts how they should be done, execute.
